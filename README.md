Some C code game programming practice using 'raylib'

My goal here is to make my own version of bomberman, using the C game programming library "Raylib".

"bomberman.c" contains basic primitives drawing, keyboard oriented movement and a square collision system;
"spriteMovement.c" contains a basic sprite drawing and movement implementation.
